# Changelog

All notable changes to Quantalyze will be documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to a 4-digit MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO scheme so `/ship`
can bump without ambiguity.

## [0.4.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **My Allocation page** — `/allocations` is now a Scenarios-style live view of the allocator's actual exchange-connected investments. Each row is a real investment the allocator made by giving a team a read-only API key on their exchange account. KPI strip (TWR / CAGR / Sharpe / Sortino / Max DD / Avg |corr|), SVG equity curve, and per-investment list — all driven by the scenario math library applied to real data. Inline **Exchange connections** section (powered by the existing `AllocatorExchangeManager`) so the allocator can connect another exchange without navigating away.
- **Allocator-editable investment aliases** — migration 025 adds `portfolio_strategies.alias TEXT NULL`. Each row on My Allocation has a pencil icon that flips into an inline editor; saving PATCHes `/api/portfolio-strategies/alias` and the UI refreshes. Falls back to the strategy's canonical display name when unset.
- **Connections page** at `/connections` — the allocator's intro relationships with strategy managers, promoted from the old cross-portfolio `/allocations` section into its own route. Now has a server-side allocator role guard so managers who hit the URL directly get redirected.
- **Scenario math library** at `src/lib/scenario.ts` — extracted the ~250-line `computeScenario` function out of `ScenarioBuilder.tsx` so it can power both `/scenarios` (unchanged) and the new `/allocations` view. All three regression-critical behaviors from the lift are preserved and pinned by 17 unit tests: per-strategy staggered-start weight renormalization, absolute-value avg pairwise correlation, and Sortino dividing the downside RMS by total observations (not by the count of negative days).
- **Partial unique index** on `portfolios (user_id) WHERE is_test = false` (migration 023) enforces the one-real-portfolio-per-allocator invariant at the database level. Kept across the pivot even though the Test Portfolios surface was dropped — the invariant is still valuable.
- **`user_favorites` table** (migration 024) — created for future watchlist features. No UI ships against it in v0.4.0 after the Scenarios-replaces-Test-Portfolios pivot; the table persists as infrastructure.
- **PATCH `/api/portfolio-strategies/alias`** — auth-gated endpoint that lets the allocator rename an investment row. Ownership check on the parent portfolio before the UPDATE, alias capped at 120 characters, empty string coerces to null.
- **34 new tests across 3 new test files** — `scenario.test.ts` (17 tests, including all 3 regression pins), `queries.my-allocation.test.ts` (7 tests for the query helpers + dashboard payload), `Sidebar.test.tsx` (10 tests for the allocator-vs-manager workspace split).

### Changed
- **Sidebar split** — allocators see **My Allocation → Connections → Scenarios → Recommendations**. Managers and crypto teams see **Strategies → Portfolios**. "Strategies" is no longer shown to allocators (that's the manager surface — crypto teams publishing strategies for allocators to discover via the Discovery group). The legacy "Exchanges" top-level entry is folded into My Allocation.
- **`/allocations` full rewrite** — the old cross-portfolio aggregate view (4 KPI cards, portfolio list, Active Alerts banner, Active Connections section) is gone. Connections moved to `/connections`, the single-real-portfolio view is now the dashboard, and exchange connections live inline below.
- **Migrations 023 + 024 are now idempotent** — every `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `CREATE POLICY` is guarded with `IF NOT EXISTS` or a `DO $$ EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_object THEN NULL` block, matching the convention in migrations 009 / 012 / 014 / 016.
- **`getMyAllocationDashboard`** — parallel-fetches the real portfolio, analytics, `portfolio_strategies` (with `alias` from migration 025 + raw `daily_returns`), `api_keys`, and alerts in one round. No favorites, no test portfolios.
- **`/portfolios` page** — reverted to the old "Portfolios" title for the manager/crypto-team workspace. Allocators no longer link here.
- **Connections page** `avgSharpe` — separate `sharpeCount` accumulator (was incorrectly sharing the CAGR counter), dynamic category slug for detail links (was hardcoded to `/discovery/crypto-sma/`), server-side role guard redirecting non-allocators.

### Removed
- **Test Portfolios concept** entirely. No `/api/test-portfolios` route, no Save-as-Test modal, no renamed `/portfolios` page, no `getTestPortfolios` query helper. Scenarios is the what-if exploration surface.
- **Favorites panel** and **FavoriteStar** — watchlist UI dropped. The `user_favorites` table stays as future infrastructure.
- **`/api/favorites`** POST/DELETE route.
- **Custom dashboard components** — `FundKPIStrip`, `StrategyMtdBars` replaced by the reused ScenarioBuilder-style `MetricCard` grid and inline equity curve. `PortfolioEquityCurve` is no longer called from `/allocations` (the Scenarios-style SVG curve is inlined in `MyAllocationClient` instead).

## [0.3.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Scenario Builder** at `/scenarios` (allocator-only) — interactive toggle-based what-if tool. Pick a subset of the 15 strategies, set per-strategy weight and "include from" date, watch every metric recompute live client-side in ~5-15ms per toggle. Recomputes TWR, CAGR, volatility, Sharpe, Sortino, max drawdown + duration, pairwise Pearson correlation matrix, avg pairwise correlation. Reuses the existing `CorrelationHeatmap`. Custom SVG equity curve. Quick presets: All / None / Equal weight. This is the decision-support tool allocators use to test "should I divest from X" or "should I add Y in month Z" before touching the real book.
- **Allocator Exchange Manager** at `/exchanges` (allocator-only) — allocator-facing page for uploading read-only exchange API keys to auto-build the Active Allocation portfolio from exchange-derived positions and lifecycle events. Modal with the existing `ApiKeyForm`, posts to `/api/keys/validate-and-encrypt` (validated against exchange, encrypted with per-user KEK before storage, trading/withdrawal keys rejected). Lists connected exchanges with sync status, last-synced relative time, reported balance. "Sync now" per-key refreshes `last_sync_at`. Direct link to the derived Active Allocation portfolio as the canonical output. Plain-English explainer card covering the `source='auto'` allocation_events derivation pattern.
- **Full-app demo seed** (`scripts/seed-full-app-demo.ts`) — replaces the 3-persona /demo-page seed with a realistic full-dashboard allocator experience. 1 allocator (`demo-allocator@quantalyze.test` / `DemoAlpha2026!`, Atlas Family Office), 8 managers across institutional + exploratory tiers, 15 strategies covering the real crypto-quant archetype universe (cross-exchange arb, basis carry, funding capture, BTC trend, altcoin momentum, L/S pairs, stat arb, short vol, iron condor, mean reversion, DEX MM, on-chain alpha, liquidation fade, risk parity, ML factor). Each strategy has 2-4 years of deterministic daily returns with explicit regime hits for 2022-05 LUNA, 2022-11 FTX, and 2024-04 correction. Complete `strategy_analytics` rows (returns_series, drawdown_series, monthly_returns, daily_returns, rolling 30/90/180d Sharpe, return quantiles, sparklines, all scalar metrics). 3 portfolios (1 real Active Allocation + 2 what-if scenarios) with full `portfolio_analytics` JSONB. 28 `allocation_events` covering the add → top-up → drawdown trim → re-add lifecycle on the real book.
- **Sidebar navigation** adds "Scenarios" and "Exchanges" under `MY WORKSPACE` for allocators (hidden from managers and from admins who have the Match Queue instead).
- **Demo walkthrough doc** at `docs/demos/2026-04-09-full-app-walkthrough.md` — click-by-click demo script with login credentials, seed summary, 5-act flow, known limitations, and post-demo housekeeping.

### Changed
- `/demo` editorial page and its 3-persona seed are superseded by the full-dashboard experience. The old /demo page still loads but is no longer the canonical allocator view.
- `portfolio_strategies.status='published'` is now the canonical status for seeded strategies (previously `'verified'`, which doesn't match the table's CHECK constraint).

### Fixed
- Seed `allocation_events.source` uses the allowed `'auto'` / `'manual'` enum values. Prior drafts used `'exchange_sync'` which silently failed the CHECK constraint.
- Silent failures in seed upserts — every insert path now throws with the table name and the Supabase error message so drift can't hide.

### Security
- Migrations 020/021/022 (landed separately via Supabase MCP earlier in the day) are documented in their own branch, not this one. Highlighted here for the release notes: real PII revoke on `profiles` (the 012/017 column-level revoke was a silent no-op against the table-level grant), SECURITY DEFINER RPC lockdown on `send_intro_with_decision` / `sync_trades` / `latest_cron_success`, and `public_profiles` view switched to `security_invoker=on`.

### Highest-priority follow-up
- **Multistrategy Dashboard** (`/overview`) — top-level allocator overview showing all strategies across all portfolios overlaid on one YTD PnL chart, MTD PnL horizontal bars, and fund-level AUM/24h/MTD/YTD KPIs. Data layer ready via the seed above. See `TODOS.md` for the full spec. Estimated 45-90 min, all client-side.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Editorial hero for the public `/demo` page — one Instrument Serif headline, four Geist Mono numbers, one "Download IC Report" CTA. Verdict / Evidence / Action / Appendix layout replaces the old 9-card mosaic.
- Per-persona demo experience via `?persona=active|cold|stalled`, backed by a server-side enum lookup that rejects hostile input (including `__proto__`) and hardcodes allocator UUIDs.
- Insight strip: biggest-risk / regime-change / underperformance / concentration-creep sentences derived from `portfolio_analytics`. Never shows a composite score.
- Winners/losers strip: top 3 contributors and bottom 3 detractors from attribution, stable sort by strategy ID on ties.
- "What we'd do in your shoes" + "Where would the next $5M go?" recommendation narrative reading `optimizer_suggestions` directly.
- Counterfactual strip: "Had you allocated 12 months ago: portfolio +X% vs BTC +Y%".
- `/api/demo/portfolio-pdf/[id]` — new public PDF endpoint with HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens (30 min TTL), allowlist-gated to the 3 persona portfolios, shares the existing Puppeteer concurrency semaphore. The authenticated `/api/portfolio-pdf/[id]` is unchanged.
- `/api/cron/warm-analytics` — Vercel Cron handler (every 5 min) that pings the Python analytics service `/health` endpoint to keep cold-start latency off the forwarded-URL path. Accepts both GET (cron default) and POST (manual probe).
- `/portfolios/[id]` now wires 7 previously-orphaned chart components: `PortfolioEquityCurve`, `CorrelationHeatmap`, `AttributionBar`, `BenchmarkComparison`, `CompositionDonut`, `RiskAttribution`. Below-the-fold charts lazy-load via `next/dynamic`.
- Stale-fallback analytics: `getPortfolioAnalyticsWithFallback` fetches latest + latest-where-status=complete in parallel so a failed run renders last-good data with a stale badge instead of an error card.
- `<CardShell>` primitive with 4 states (loading / ready / stale / unavailable) for the authenticated dashboard. Cards never disappear — only their content does.
- `<MorningBriefing>` shared component between `/demo` (dek variant) and `/portfolios/[id]` (card variant).
- `portfolio-analytics-adapter`: strict typed adapter at the Supabase boundary. Defends against prototype-key poisoning from JSONB and rejects empty-string / boolean numeric coercion.
- `ResizeObserver` stub in `src/test-setup.ts` so chart components can render under vitest+jsdom.
- 4-digit VERSION file and CHANGELOG.md for clean version tracking.

### Changed
- `PortfolioAnalytics` TypeScript types corrected to match what `analytics-service/routers/portfolio.py` actually persists: `rolling_correlation` is now `Record<string, {date,value}[]>` (pair-keyed), `benchmark_comparison` is a single object (not a `Record`), `attribution_breakdown` and `risk_decomposition` use the real field names (`contribution` + `allocation_effect`; `marginal_risk_pct` + `standalone_vol` + `component_var` + `weight_pct`).
- `StrategyBreakdownTable` and the authenticated portfolio-pdf page drop dead reads on `attr.weight` / `attr.twr` — fields that never existed in the persisted payload. Weights now come from `portfolio_strategies.current_weight`, TWR from `strategy_analytics.cagr`.
- `/demo` rewrite preserves the existing two-batch match fallback chain (`batches[0] → batches[1]`) via an extracted, unit-tested `resolveDemoRecommendations` helper.
- Package version bumped from `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`.

### Fixed
- Pre-landing review catches (Codex adversarial + Claude checklist):
  - Cron route now exports GET + POST (was POST-only; Vercel Cron sends GET).
  - Demo PDF endpoint switched to `Cache-Control: no-store` so the CDN can't replay a response past the 30 min signed-token TTL.
  - Demo page now only signs a PDF token when the current persona has a seeded portfolio in the allowlist; no silent cross-wire to the active persona's report.
  - Warmup helper clears its timeout handle on the sync-throw path.

### Removed
- Portfolio Health Score card — killed before implementation per 4-signal cross-phase cross-model consensus (Claude + Codex, CEO + Design). Composite scores are a taste landmine for institutional LPs; the hero is now raw metrics with explicit provenance.
