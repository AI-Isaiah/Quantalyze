/**
 * Phase 90.5 (LEV-01, CONTEXT D2/D5) — the NARROW, EPHEMERAL leverage context.
 *
 * Kept in a NEW file rather than the FROZEN `factsheet-context.tsx` (D7): it
 * mirrors `basis-context.tsx`'s split-context template (a narrow context +
 * memoized value + a hook that throws outside its provider) WITHOUT importing
 * any frozen state internals.
 *
 * GUARD-04 (ephemeral by construction, T-90.5-07): this file contains NO
 * browser-storage, cookie, URL query, or history-API access anywhere. Leverage
 * lives in component state only, so every fresh view opens on L=1 (the real
 * track) and dialing leverage writes nothing to the URL or storage. Pinned by
 * `leverage-context.test.tsx` (Test 6 source scan).
 *
 * The metrics hook is the L===1-identity / L!==1-recompute switch: at L=1 it
 * returns the cash-basis metrics object UNTOUCHED (same reference — byte
 * identity, no recompute), and at L!==1 it re-runs the SAME `compute()` on the
 * leverage-scaled return series (NOT an analytic rescale) so path-dependent
 * KPIs — cum/CAGR/maxDD — stay honest. The multiplier is clamped at the compute
 * seam via `sanitizeLeverage` (shared contract, D5; T-90.5-06).
