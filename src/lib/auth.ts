 *
 * M-0501 (audit-2026-05-07): memoized so duplicate calls inside the same
 * logical scope with the same `(supabase, userId)` pair share one DB
 * round-trip.
 *
 * Implementation note: originally wrapped with React `cache()` for
 * RSC-render-scope dedup, but `cache()` in React 19 is ONLY active inside
 * the renderer's per-request AsyncLocalStorage — Route Handlers and any
 * non-RSC execution path get NO dedup. Vitest also cannot observe the
 * dedup, so the contract test (auth.test.ts:272) was unprovable. We now
 * use a WeakMap keyed on the SupabaseClient instance, with an inner Map
 * of `userId → Promise<GetUserRolesResult>`. This makes the dedup
 * deterministic in every environment (RSC, Route Handler, Edge, vitest)
 * while preserving the existing safety property: distinct SupabaseClient
 * instances do NOT share cache entries, so a fresh client per request
 * (the standard `await createClient()` pattern) gets fresh roles. The
 * outer WeakMap lets the entire role map garbage-collect when the client
 * is released, so there is no cross-request leak.
 *
 * Cross-user contamination is impossible while distinct SupabaseClient
 * instances are passed. The `withRole` wrapper guarantees this — it
 * builds ONE client via `createClient()` and reuses it for `getUser()` +
 * `requireRole()` + the handler context. `createClient()` itself is NOT
 * memoized, so two `await createClient()` calls in the same request
 * return two distinct clients and bypass this cache. New call sites
 * outside `withRole` must reuse a single client per request or accept
 * the duplicate round-trip.
 *
 * DANGER ZONE: if a future refactor wraps `createClient()` with a cache
 * that yields the SAME instance for two requests inside a warm Lambda,
 * two requests could share both the SupabaseClient identity AND the
 * resolved role set — cross-user contamination becomes possible. Pin
 * fresh-per-request before landing such a refactor. Cross-request
 * caching (JWT custom claims, Edge Config) is tracked as a Sprint 7
 * follow-up — see ADR-0005.
 *
 * NEW-C15-03 (audit-2026-05-26 red-team): INTRA-REQUEST TOCTOU WINDOW.
 * The memo FREEZES the role set for the lifetime of the SupabaseClient
 * used in a given request. A role REVOKE that lands between the outer
 * `withRole` gate and a subsequent `getUserRoles`/`requireRole` call on
 * the SAME client (e.g. inside an `after()`-deferred task, or a long-
 * running streaming response) will NOT be observed — the cached promise
 * returns the pre-revoke role set. This creates an intra-request
 * staleness window that `requireAdmin` (which always re-queries fresh)
 * does NOT share, so the two verification paths DISAGREE after a revoke.
 *
 * MANDATORY RULE: privileged RPCs (sanitize_user, log_audit_event_service,
 * or any SECURITY DEFINER function) MUST be gated by `requireAdmin` or
 * `isAdminUser` — NOT by `getUserRoles`/`requireRole` after the initial
 * `withRole` check. These helpers issue a fresh DB query and are
 * unaffected by the memo. See {@link requireAdmin} for the recommended
 * TOCTOU-close pattern.
 *
 * Use {@link getUserRoles} only for read-only authorization decisions
 * that can tolerate the intra-request window (e.g. reading the role set
 * to shape a UI response, where a stale 'admin' grants no extra write
 * privilege beyond what is already gated at the RPC level).

 *   - a `NextResponse` — caller is no longer an admin (or never was);
 *     return this response immediately. Caller MUST NOT continue.

 *
 * NEW-C36-01 (B4): `req` is now REQUIRED (was optional). Every mutating

 * skipped — omitting it is a compile error, which structurally closes the

 * sub-resource re-checks pass their handler's request and skip the origin
 * check via the safe-method branch below.
 *
 * Defense-in-depth (call sites are encouraged to pass `req` even

 * gate, leaving a latent fail-open for any future non-admin role route. Without
 * the gate, a freshly-registered but UNAPPROVED user who holds a role enum row
 * (every new signup lands with a role but unapproved) can reach the handler. For
 * admin routes today `isProfileApproved` short-circuits on `is_admin=true` (no
 * observable bug), but Sprint 7 plans to route `allocator`/`quant_manager`/
 * `analyst` roles through this same wrapper — those users CAN be unapproved.
 *
 * Default: `requireApproval: true`. Opt out only for routes that explicitly
 * serve pending-approval callers (e.g. an account-deletion route or a public
 * status endpoint). Mirror of {@link WithAuthOptions} in `withAuth.ts`.
