// audit-2026-05-07 H-0517 — branded identifier vocabulary
//
// SEC-005 was the canonical class: a strategies row's `api_key_id` could
// point at another user's key, but the TS type system would let any
// string from any source flow into the field. The SQL trigger added in
// migration 028 catches this at the DB boundary; branded id types make
// the same invariant visible to the compiler — code that mixes ids of
// different owning entities becomes a type error.
//
// USAGE NOTES (current rollout = type vocabulary only):
//   - The branded aliases are EXPORTED so new code can opt into the
//     invariant. The existing interface fields below still type these
//     ids as `string` to keep the broader codebase compiling without a
//     cross-cutting cast-everywhere refactor. Callers reading rows from
//     Supabase can stamp the brand via the `cast*Id()` helpers below.
//   - When the codebase migrates to branded ids at the DTO/cast boundary
//     in a follow-up PR, the interface fields below will be retyped and
//     the cascading call-site fixes happen at once.
//   - Cross-tenant assignments (e.g. assigning an `ApiKeyId` belonging
//     to user B into `Strategy.api_key_id` of user A) are not yet
//     statically impossible — the SQL trigger remains the load-bearing
//     check. The brand makes the intent EXPRESSIBLE; full enforcement is
//     a deliberate next step.

// audit-2026-05-07 H-0514 / H-0515 / H-0516 / M-0580 / M-0584 — unit vocabulary
//
// The v0.17.1 KPI-17 saga (PRs #95-100) was caused by this exact drift:
// Python returned percent-scaled, TS multiplied by 100 again, allocators
// saw 5500%. The root cause was that every numeric metric — fraction
// (0.05), percent (5.0), unitless ratio (0.5), score (5), days, hours,
// seconds, USD — flowed through the same bare `number` type.
//
// File-wide UNIT CONTRACT (binding for new code, normative for review):
//   - Every field whose name ends in `_pct` is a FRACTION in [0,1] (0.05 = 5%).
//   - Every field whose name ends in `_days`, `_seconds`, `_hours`,
//     `_minutes` is the named unit. No conversion at field level.
//   - Every field whose name ends in `_usd` or `_usdt` is a money quantity
//     in the named denomination (USD ≠ USDT for the purposes of math).
//   - `risk_reward_ratio` / `profit_factor*` / `payoff_ratio` are
//     UNITLESS RATIOS (0.5 means 0.5×, not 50%).
//   - `sqn` is a SCORE (System Quality Number, 0-7 typical range).
//   - `expectancy` is a FRACTION (per-trade expected return as a fraction
//     of risked capital).
//
// Branded aliases are exported so new code can express intent at types.
// Existing interface fields remain `number` for the same reason as the
// branded ids above — full migration is a deliberate cross-cutting PR,
// not a sneak-in. New writers should reach for the branded alias when
// adding fields.
//
// PRECISION FOOTNOTE (H-0515): USD-denominated NUMERIC columns lose
// precision through JSON.parse → IEEE-754 for values > 2^53 (~$9
// quadrillion). For realistic hedge-fund AUMs (< $10B) the float
// representation is exact at cent boundaries. Branded `Usd` / `Usdt`
// stays a `number` to match the wire shape; future Decimal migration
// would change the brand's underlying type, not the field name.
